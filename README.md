# ibz_pic16f887_atmega4809
A basic adapter-board I've made to replace the slow PIC16F887 with a ATmega4809 on the dev board of the school. Might not be 100% compatible with the PIC's I/Os, but compatible enough to replace it on the dev board.

The BOM is so small that I didn't even made one, as the components used there are rather obvious.
The only special component used in the actual thing were the "Flip-Pins" from EvilMadScientist, since I did not want to stress / bend socket on the dev-board too much.
